# kafka-python-client-postgres

This App is a Python >= 2.7 client that subscribes to topics of any Kafka Broker in this case we used Confluent Kafka Broker. This client uses Confluent Kafka Python client to subscribe and the consume messages in JSON format of certain topics and the store such messages in POSTGRESQL is totally customizable. Just use the command "python pyConsumer.py -h" (without quotes) to see the options available or run the example bash file using the command "./run-consumer-test.sh" which will execute an example of the consumer client.

Enjoy!
